# protoLayers

Revamp of [mightyLayers](https://github.com/Inventsable/mightyLayers) while absorbing [Scribe](https://github.com/Inventsable/scribe) functions, this will be a replica of the native Layers panel with added functionality like keyboard navigation.

## To-do:

* ~~Basic UI~~
* Basic backend for recursive layer crawling
* Selection logic
* Active Layer logic
* Subtle bodymovin' animations for all icons (vanilla Layers panel has animated arrows)
* Multiple scanners to prompt new crawl for panel update: selection, layer number, pageItem number, activeLayer
* Automatic stripping of `' copy'` from layer names
* Replicate bottom toolbar
* Easily rename layers by pressing `Enter`
* Easily rename in bulk with `Tab`
* Easily traverse layers or select multiple with `Arrow Up/Down`
* Easily traverse inside/fold/unfold layer with `Arrow Right/Left`
* Dynamic context menu to replace the way too busy vanilla Flyout menu
* Select Label Group function like After Effects
* Optional `Object` icon before layer name to display type similar to After Effects' handling of Shape and Text layers
* Perfect UI : Vanilla Theme / Future Theme
